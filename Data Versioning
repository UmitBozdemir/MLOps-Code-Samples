# Data versioning in MLOps refers to the process of tracking and managing changes made to the input data used for training machine learning models. This includes keeping a record of the different versions of datasets used for training, testing, and validation, as well as the source of the data, its format, and any pre-processing steps applied to it.

# Effective data versioning is crucial for reproducibility, as it enables machine learning engineers and data scientists to understand how changes to the input data affect the performance of their models over time. By versioning data, MLOps teams can ensure that they can easily roll back to earlier versions of the data if necessary, and can also make sure that their models are trained using the most up-to-date and accurate data available.

# Data versioning is typically implemented using version control systems, such as Git or SVN, which allow teams to track changes to data files in much the same way as they track changes to code. This enables them to collaborate more effectively and to maintain a complete audit trail of all changes made to the data used for model training.

# Here's a code sample using Git to track and manage data versions in MLOps:
# Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:
$ git init

# Create a .gitignore file to exclude any large data files from being committed to Git:
*.csv
*.json
*.h5

# Add your training data to the project directory:
$ cp /path/to/training/data.csv data/training_data.csv

# Stage and commit the data file to Git:
$ git add data/training_data.csv
$ git commit -m "Initial training data"

# Train your machine learning model using the data file:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

data = pd.read_csv('data/training_data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Create a new version of the training data by making some changes to it:
$ cp /path/to/new/training/data.csv data/training_data.csv

# Stage and commit the new version of the data file to Git:
$ git add data/training_data.csv
$ git commit -m "New training data"

# Train your machine learning model using the new version of the data file:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

data = pd.read_csv('data/training_data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# To view the history of changes made to the data file, use the git log command:
$ git log -- data/training_data.csv

# This code sample demonstrates how to use Git to track changes made to training data files in MLOps. By versioning data files in this way, MLOps teams can ensure that they can easily reproduce the results of their machine learning models and maintain a complete audit trail of all changes made to the data used for training.
