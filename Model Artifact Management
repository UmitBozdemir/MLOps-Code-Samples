# Model artifact management in MLOps refers to the process of systematically storing, versioning, and tracking the machine learning models and related artifacts, such as data sets, feature engineering pipelines, model configurations, and evaluation metrics.

# It involves the use of tools and techniques to ensure that the models used in production are reliable, reproducible, and auditable. Model artifact management also involves managing dependencies between models and their artifacts, ensuring that the appropriate versions of artifacts are used for each model.

# The goal of model artifact management is to maintain the quality and consistency of machine learning models throughout their lifecycle, from development to deployment and monitoring. This enables teams to collaborate efficiently, reproduce results, and respond quickly to changes in the models or their environments.

# Here is a code sample of model artifact management using MLflow, which is an open-source platform for the complete machine learning lifecycle:
import mlflow

# Start a new MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Train a model
    model = train_model()

    # Log the model artifact
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "my-model")

    # Log additional artifacts, such as data sets and feature engineering pipelines
    mlflow.log_artifact("my-data.csv", "data")
    mlflow.log_artifact("my-pipeline.pkl", "pipeline")

    # Log evaluation metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)

    # Set tags to track metadata
    mlflow.set_tag("team", "data-science")
    mlflow.set_tag("version", "v1.0")

    # Save the run ID for future reference
    run_id = mlflow.active_run().info.run_id

# In this code sample, MLflow is used to log the trained machine learning model, additional artifacts, and evaluation metrics. The mlflow.start_run() function starts a new run, and all subsequent artifacts and metrics are associated with that run. The mlflow.sklearn.log_model() function logs the trained model, which can be later retrieved and deployed. The mlflow.log_artifact() function logs additional artifacts, such as data sets and feature engineering pipelines. The mlflow.log_metric() function logs evaluation metrics, such as accuracy. Finally, the mlflow.set_tag() function is used to set tags for tracking metadata, such as team and version information.
