# Model performance monitoring is a crucial component of MLOps, which refers to the practice of monitoring the performance of machine learning models deployed in production to ensure that they continue to function as intended over time.

# In other words, model performance monitoring involves tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, among others, to evaluate how well the model is performing and detect any changes or degradation in its performance.

# The goal of model performance monitoring is to ensure that machine learning models are operating within acceptable levels of accuracy and to identify any issues that may arise due to changes in data, infrastructure, or other external factors. This helps data scientists and engineers to take proactive measures to maintain model performance and optimize the overall performance of the machine learning pipeline.

# Model performance monitoring typically involves setting up automated monitoring and alerting systems that notify the relevant stakeholders when performance metrics fall below certain thresholds or when anomalies are detected. This allows for timely intervention to address any issues and prevent costly downtime or suboptimal performance.

# Here's an example of model performance monitoring in MLOps using Python and scikit-learn library:
# Import required libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Split the dataset into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a logistic regression model on the training set
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test set and calculate accuracy
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Monitor model performance over time
while True:
    # Evaluate the model on a new batch of data
    X_new, y_new = load_new_data()
    y_pred_new = clf.predict(X_new)
    accuracy_new = accuracy_score(y_new, y_pred_new)
    
    # Compare the new performance metrics with the previous ones
    if accuracy_new < accuracy - 0.02:
        send_alert("Model performance has degraded")
    else:
        print("Model performance is stable")
    
    # Update the current performance metrics
    accuracy = accuracy_new

# In this example, we first load the iris dataset and split it into training and testing sets. We then train a logistic regression model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set using the accuracy metric.

# We then set up a loop to continuously monitor the performance of the model over time. In each iteration of the loop, we load a new batch of data and evaluate the model's performance on that data using the same metric. We then compare the new performance metrics with the previous ones and send an alert if there has been a significant drop in accuracy.

# This example is simplified and does not include all the components of a real-world MLOps system, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment. However, it demonstrates the basic concept of monitoring model performance over time and taking action when necessary to maintain the model's accuracy.
