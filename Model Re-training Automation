# Model re-training automation in MLOps refers to the process of automatically updating and re-training machine learning models as new data becomes available or when the performance of the model deteriorates over time. This process involves leveraging various tools and techniques to automate the end-to-end process of re-training the model, including data collection, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.

# The automation of model re-training is crucial in MLOps as it ensures that models are continuously updated and improved to reflect changes in the underlying data distribution. This can help organizations to maintain the accuracy and reliability of their models, leading to better business outcomes and customer satisfaction.

# To achieve model re-training automation in MLOps, organizations typically employ a combination of techniques, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, containerization, and orchestration tools. These tools can help streamline the process of model re-training, enabling organizations to deploy updated models quickly and efficiently.

# Here is a high-level code sample that demonstrates how model re-training automation can be implemented in MLOps using Python and TensorFlow:
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the existing model and data
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split the data into training and validation sets
train_data = data.sample(frac=0.8, random_state=123)
val_data = data.drop(train_data.index)

# Define the model architecture and compile it
new_model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
new_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])

# Train the new model using the training data
history = new_model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data)

# Evaluate the new model's performance on the validation set
val_loss, val_mae = new_model.evaluate(val_data)

# Check if the new model's performance has improved
if val_loss < model.history.history['val_loss'][-1]:
    # Save the new model to disk
    new_model.save('model.h5')
    print('New model saved successfully!')
else:
    print('New model did not outperform the previous model.')

# In this example, we first load an existing model and data. We then split the data into training and validation sets and define a new model architecture. We train the new model using the training data and evaluate its performance on the validation set. Finally, we compare the new model's performance to the existing model and save the new model if it performs better.

# This code can be run on a scheduled basis to automate the process of model re-training. Additionally, MLOps pipelines can be used to automate the data loading, preprocessing, and deployment processes, further streamlining the model re-training workflow.
