# Infrastructure provisioning automation in MLOps refers to the use of tools and processes to automate the deployment and management of the computing infrastructure required to train and deploy machine learning models. This includes the automation of tasks such as setting up virtual machines, configuring networking, installing software dependencies, and managing storage. By automating these tasks, MLOps teams can accelerate the development and deployment of machine learning models, reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies, and improve overall efficiency. Infrastructure provisioning automation is a critical component of MLOps, as it allows teams to focus on developing and refining models, rather than spending time on manual infrastructure setup and maintenance.

# Here is an example of code for infrastructure provisioning automation in MLOps using Terraform, a popular infrastructure as code tool:
# Define the provider (in this case, AWS)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Define the EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "ml_model" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Define the networking
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.ml_security_group.id}"]
  subnet_id              = "${aws_subnet.ml_subnet.id}"
  associate_public_ip_address = true

  # Define the script to run on startup
  user_data = <<EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              # Install required packages
              apt-get update
              apt-get install -y python3-pip git
              # Clone the ML model code repository
              git clone https://github.com/example/ml-model.git
              # Install Python dependencies
              pip3 install -r /ml-model/requirements.txt
              # Start the model training script
              python3 /ml-model/train.py
              EOF
}

# Define the security group
resource "aws_security_group" "ml_security_group" {
  name_prefix = "ml-"
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Define the subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "ml_subnet" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}
In this example, we are using Terraform to define an AWS EC2 instance, a security group, and a subnet for deploying an ML model. The EC2 instance is configured to install the necessary dependencies and run the model training script on startup. The security group is defined to allow SSH and HTTP traffic, while the subnet is defined with a specific IP range. By using Terraform, we can version control and automate the deployment and configuration of our infrastructure, making it easier to maintain and scale over time.
