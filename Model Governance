# Model governance in MLOps refers to the process of managing and controlling the lifecycle of machine learning models in a systematic and organized way. It involves implementing policies, procedures, and tools to ensure that models are developed, deployed, and maintained in a secure, compliant, and reliable manner.

# Model governance is critical in MLOps because machine learning models are complex systems that require careful monitoring and management to ensure that they function as intended and do not produce biased or unfair results. The key elements of model governance include model documentation, version control, testing, validation, monitoring, and auditing.

# Effective model governance requires collaboration between data scientists, engineers, business stakeholders, and compliance teams. It also involves establishing clear accountability and ownership for model development, deployment, and maintenance. By implementing a robust model governance framework, organizations can minimize the risk of model failure, improve the reliability of their models, and ensure that they comply with regulatory and ethical standards.

# Here is a code sample of a basic model governance framework for MLOps:
# Load required libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Define functions for model training, testing, and validation
def train_model(X_train, y_train):
  model = LogisticRegression()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  return model

def test_model(model, X_test, y_test):
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
  accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  return accuracy

def validate_model(model, X_val, y_val):
  # Perform additional validation checks (e.g., bias, fairness, robustness)
  pass

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split data into train, test, and validation sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2)

# Train model and save to disk
model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
model.save('model.pkl')

# Test model and report accuracy
accuracy = test_model(model, X_test, y_test)
print('Model accuracy:', accuracy)

# Validate model and report results
validate_model(model, X_val, y_val)

# This code sample includes functions for model training, testing, and validation. It also demonstrates how to load and preprocess data, split it into train, test, and validation sets, and save the trained model to disk. Finally, it reports the accuracy of the model on the test set and performs additional validation checks (which are left blank in this example).

# Note that this is a simplified example, and a more comprehensive model governance framework would include additional steps, such as version control, model monitoring, and auditing.
