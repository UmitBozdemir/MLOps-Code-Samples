# Automated deployment rollbacks in MLOps refer to the process of automatically undoing or reverting a machine learning model deployment to a previous version or configuration when an error or issue is detected. This can happen when a new model deployment causes a significant drop in performance, or when it introduces errors or issues that were not present in the previous version.

# In MLOps, automated deployment rollbacks are a crucial component of a robust and reliable model deployment pipeline. By automating the rollback process, organizations can quickly respond to issues and minimize the impact on customers or users. This is particularly important in mission-critical applications, where downtime or incorrect predictions can have severe consequences.

# Automated deployment rollbacks are typically triggered by predefined thresholds or alerts that detect performance or stability issues. When such an issue is detected, the system will automatically revert to the last known good configuration or version, thereby avoiding the need for manual intervention and minimizing downtime.

# Overall, automated deployment rollbacks are an essential component of a robust and reliable MLOps infrastructure, ensuring that models are deployed quickly, reliably, and with minimal disruption to end-users.

# Here's a sample code implementation of automated deployment rollbacks in MLOps using Python and the Flask web framework:
import os
import subprocess
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/deploy_model', methods=['POST'])
def deploy_model():
    # Perform the model deployment
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['./deploy.sh'])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        # If an error occurs, trigger a rollback
        rollback()
        return 'Model deployment failed', 500
    return 'Model deployed successfully'

def rollback():
    # Revert to the last known good version
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['./rollback.sh'])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        # If the rollback fails, raise an error
        raise RuntimeError('Rollback failed')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

# In this example, the deploy_model function performs the model deployment using a shell script (deploy.sh). If the deployment fails, the rollback function is called to revert to the last known good version using another shell script (rollback.sh). If the rollback also fails, a RuntimeError is raised.

# This code can be extended to include additional functionality, such as monitoring for performance or stability issues and triggering a rollback automatically when certain thresholds are met. The implementation of automated deployment rollbacks will vary depending on the specific MLOps infrastructure and tools being used.
