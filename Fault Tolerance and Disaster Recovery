# Fault tolerance and disaster recovery are two critical concepts in MLOps that are crucial for ensuring the reliability and availability of machine learning systems.

# Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue operating even when one or more of its components fail. In MLOps, fault tolerance can be achieved through redundant systems, backup models, and automated error detection and recovery mechanisms. For example, if one server in a cluster fails, the load can be automatically transferred to other servers in the cluster, ensuring that the system remains operational.

# Disaster recovery, on the other hand, is the process of restoring a system to its normal operating state after a catastrophic event such as a natural disaster, cyber attack, or hardware failure. In MLOps, disaster recovery typically involves having a well-defined plan and infrastructure in place to quickly recover from such events. This may include backup data storage, redundant systems in different geographical locations, and procedures for restoring critical systems and data.

# Both fault tolerance and disaster recovery are essential for ensuring the reliability and availability of machine learning systems in production. By incorporating these concepts into the design and deployment of MLOps pipelines, organizations can minimize the risk of downtime, data loss, and other disruptive events that can negatively impact their business operations.

# Here's an example of how fault tolerance and disaster recovery can be implemented in MLOps:
# Fault Tolerance:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a function that loads a trained model and returns it
def load_model():
  model = keras.models.load_model('model.h5')
  return model

# Define a function that attempts to load a model and retries if it fails
def load_model_with_retry():
  retries = 3
  for i in range(retries):
    try:
      model = load_model()
      return model
    except:
      print(f"Failed to load model (attempt {i+1}/{retries})")
      continue
  raise Exception("Failed to load model after multiple retries")

# In this code sample, we define a function load_model_with_retry that attempts to load a trained model from a file using the load_model function from Keras. If the loading fails, the function retries a specified number of times before raising an exception. This approach ensures that even if there are intermittent failures in loading the model, the system keeps trying until it succeeds.

# Disaster Recovery:
import boto3

# Define a function that uploads data to an S3 bucket and handles exceptions
def upload_to_s3(bucket, key, data):
  s3 = boto3.client('s3')
  try:
    s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key, Body=data)
    print(f"Uploaded data to s3://{bucket}/{key}")
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to upload data to S3: {str(e)}")

# Define a function that downloads data from an S3 bucket and handles exceptions
def download_from_s3(bucket, key):
  s3 = boto3.client('s3')
  try:
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    data = response['Body'].read()
    print(f"Downloaded data from s3://{bucket}/{key}")
    return data
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to download data from S3: {str(e)}")
    return None

# In this code sample, we define two functions upload_to_s3 and download_from_s3 that handle uploading and downloading data to/from an S3 bucket using the boto3 Python library. These functions include exception handling to ensure that any failures are logged and don't interrupt the flow of the MLOps pipeline. This approach ensures that even if there are network or other issues with accessing the S3 bucket, the system can continue to operate and try again later.
