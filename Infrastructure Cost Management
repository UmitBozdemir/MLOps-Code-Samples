# Infrastructure Cost Management in MLOps refers to the process of optimizing the cost of the infrastructure used for machine learning operations (MLOps) while ensuring that the performance and reliability of the system are not compromised.

# MLOps infrastructure typically involves a range of resources, including compute instances, storage, networking, and other supporting services. As the size and complexity of MLOps projects grow, the infrastructure cost can quickly become a significant concern. Effective infrastructure cost management involves careful planning, monitoring, and optimization of the infrastructure resources to ensure that they are being used efficiently and effectively.

# Some common strategies for infrastructure cost management in MLOps include:
# Right-sizing instances: Ensuring that the resources allocated to instances are appropriately sized for the workload to avoid overprovisioning or underutilization.
# Utilizing Spot instances: Spot instances are a cost-effective way to utilize cloud resources. They allow users to bid on unused capacity, which can be significantly cheaper than on-demand instances.
# Auto-scaling: Auto-scaling can help to optimize infrastructure cost by automatically scaling up or down based on the workload demands. This allows users to only pay for resources when they are needed, reducing the overall infrastructure cost.
# Monitoring: Monitoring resource utilization and tracking costs can help to identify opportunities for optimization and cost reduction.

# Overall, effective infrastructure cost management is essential for organizations to maximize the value of their MLOps infrastructure and achieve their business objectives while staying within budget constraints.

# Here is an example of how infrastructure cost management can be implemented in MLOps using Python and AWS:
import boto3

# Define the EC2 client
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

# Get the current running instances
response = ec2_client.describe_instances(
    Filters=[{'Name': 'instance-state-name', 'Values': ['running']}]
)

# Loop through each instance and check its instance type
for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instance_type = instance['InstanceType']
        instance_id = instance['InstanceId']
        
        # Check if the instance type is optimal
        if instance_type != 't3.micro':
            # Stop the instance
            ec2_client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
            
            # Change the instance type to t3.micro
            ec2_client.modify_instance_attribute(
                InstanceId=instance_id,
                Attribute='instanceType',
                Value='t3.micro'
            )
            
            # Start the instance
            ec2_client.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
            
            print(f"Instance {instance_id} has been stopped and resized to t3.micro")

# In this code sample, we are using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to interact with the EC2 service. We first retrieve all currently running instances and loop through each instance to check if its instance type is optimal for our workload (in this case, we are assuming t3.micro is optimal).

# If an instance is found with a suboptimal instance type, we stop the instance, modify its instance type, and then start it again with the optimal instance type. We also print a message to the console to inform the user that the instance has been stopped and resized.

# By using this code, we can ensure that our instances are always running at the optimal size for our workload, thereby reducing unnecessary infrastructure costs.
