# Infrastructure orchestration in MLOps refers to the management and automation of the underlying infrastructure required to develop, train, deploy, and operate machine learning models. It involves setting up and managing the resources such as compute instances, storage, network, and software components required for ML workflows.

# Infrastructure orchestration ensures that the resources are provisioned, configured, and deployed in a consistent and repeatable manner across development, testing, and production environments. It involves defining the infrastructure as code, which can be version controlled, tested, and deployed using continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

# Infrastructure orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and AWS CloudFormation are used to automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of infrastructure resources. These tools provide a scalable, flexible, and reliable infrastructure that can support the demands of ML workflows. By automating the infrastructure setup, organizations can reduce the time and effort required to manage the infrastructure and focus on delivering high-quality machine learning models.

# Here's an example of infrastructure orchestration code using Terraform to provision and configure resources on AWS for a machine learning model training and deployment pipeline:
# Define the provider (in this case AWS)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Define a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "ml_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

# Define a security group
resource "aws_security_group" "ml_security_group" {
  name_prefix = "ml_sg_"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.ml_vpc.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Define an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "ml_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.ml_security_group.id]
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.ml_subnet.id
}

# Define a subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "ml_subnet" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.ml_vpc.id
}

# Define an S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "ml_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-ml-bucket"
}

# Define an IAM role
resource "aws_iam_role" "ml_role" {
  name = "ml_role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })
}

# Define an IAM policy
resource "aws_iam_policy" "ml_policy" {
  name        = "ml_policy"
  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Action = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"]
      Resource = [aws_s3_bucket.ml_bucket.arn, "${aws_s3_bucket.ml_bucket.arn}/*"]
    }]
  })
}

# Attach the IAM policy to the IAM role
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ml_policy_attachment" {
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.ml_policy.arn
  role       = aws_iam_role.ml_role.name
}

# Output the EC2 instance IP address
output "ml_instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.ml_instance.public_ip
}

# In this example, we're using Terraform to define and provision the resources needed for our ML workflow. We're creating an AWS VPC, a security group for the instance, an EC2 instance, a subnet, an S3 bucket for data storage, and an IAM role and policy for access to the S3 bucket.

# With this code, we can quickly and easily provision the resources needed for our ML pipeline, and we can make changes and updates to the infrastructure as code, using version control and CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent and reliable Deployments.
