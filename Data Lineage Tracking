# Data lineage tracking in MLOps refers to the process of tracking the origin, transformations, and movement of data used in machine learning workflows. It involves capturing metadata about data inputs, outputs, and transformations throughout the entire lifecycle of an ML model, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and inference.

# By tracking data lineage, MLOps teams can ensure that their models are trained on accurate and reliable data, and that any errors or inconsistencies in the data are identified and addressed. It also helps to establish transparency, accountability, and reproducibility in the ML workflow, which is crucial for regulatory compliance, model auditability, and troubleshooting.

# Some of the key benefits of data lineage tracking in MLOps include:
# Ensuring data quality and consistency: By tracking data lineage, MLOps teams can identify and address any issues with data quality or consistency, such as missing values, outliers, or data drift.
# Improving model performance: By understanding the origin and transformation of data inputs, MLOps teams can optimize their feature engineering and data preprocessing pipelines, which can lead to better model performance.
# Facilitating model auditability: By maintaining a record of data lineage, MLOps teams can easily trace the origin and transformation of data used to train and test ML models, which is crucial for model auditability and regulatory compliance.
# Enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing: By capturing and sharing metadata about data inputs and transformations, MLOps teams can facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing across different teams and stakeholders involved in the ML workflow.

# Here's a code sample that demonstrates how to implement data lineage tracking in MLOps using the open-source library called MLflow
import mlflow

# Start a new MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():

    # Log the data source
    data_source = "s3://my-bucket/my-data.csv"
    mlflow.log_param("data_source", data_source)

    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_source)

    # Preprocess the data
    data_processed = preprocess(data)

    # Log the preprocessing steps
    mlflow.log_param("preprocessing_steps", " ".join(get_preprocessing_steps()))

    # Train the model
    model = train(data_processed)

    # Log the model parameters and metrics
    mlflow.log_params(model.params)
    mlflow.log_metrics(model.metrics)

    # Save the model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

    # Log the output data
    output_data = predict(model, data_processed)
    output_path = "s3://my-bucket/my-output.csv"
    output_data.to_csv(output_path)
    mlflow.log_artifact(output_path, "output_data.csv")

# In this example, we start a new MLflow run and log the data source using mlflow.log_param(). We then load and preprocess the data, and log the preprocessing steps using another call to mlflow.log_param(). We then train the model, log the model parameters and metrics using mlflow.log_params() and mlflow.log_metrics(), and save the model using mlflow.sklearn.log_model(). Finally, we log the output data and save it to a file, which is then logged as an artifact using mlflow.log_artifact().

# By logging these parameters, metrics, and artifacts, we can easily trace the origin and transformation of the data used in the ML workflow, and reproduce the results if needed. We can also use MLflow's tracking server to visualize and analyze the data lineage graphically, and share the results with other members of the MLOps team.
