# Model Metadata Management in MLOps refers to the process of capturing and organizing metadata related to machine learning models throughout their lifecycle. This includes information such as the model's training data, hyperparameters, model architecture, performance metrics, and deployment environment.

# The goal of Model Metadata Management is to create a comprehensive record of a model's development and deployment, making it easier to track changes, reproduce results, and ensure the model meets regulatory and compliance requirements.

# Some of the key activities involved in Model Metadata Management include:
# Data Lineage: Capturing information about the data used to train the model, including its source, quality, and any transformations that were applied to it.
# Model Versioning: Tracking changes to the model's architecture and hyperparameters over time, so that different versions of the model can be compared and evaluated.
# Performance Monitoring: Collecting metrics on how the model is performing in production, such as accuracy, latency, and resource usage.
# Deployment Tracking: Maintaining a record of the model's deployment history, including the infrastructure used to host it and any changes made to the deployment over time.

# Overall, effective Model Metadata Management is critical for ensuring the reproducibility, traceability, and accountability of machine learning models, and is an essential component of any MLOps process.

# Here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how you might implement Model Metadata Management in an MLOps pipeline using the MLflow framework:
import mlflow

# Start a new MLflow run to track model metadata
with mlflow.start_run():

    # Log information about the data used to train the model
    mlflow.log_param("dataset", "iris")
    mlflow.log_param("train_size", 0.8)
    mlflow.log_param("random_seed", 42)

    # Train a machine learning model and log its hyperparameters
    model = train_model()
    mlflow.log_params(model.get_params())

    # Evaluate the model and log its performance metrics
    metrics = evaluate_model(model)
    mlflow.log_metrics(metrics)

    # Save the model artifact to MLflow
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

    # Register the model with MLflow and capture its version
    model_version = mlflow.register_model("runs:/{}/model".format(mlflow.active_run().info.run_id), "my-model")

    # Deploy the model to a production environment and log deployment details
    deploy_model(model_version)
    mlflow.log_param("deployment_timestamp", datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
    mlflow.log_param("deployment_environment", "production")

# In this example, MLflow is used to track various aspects of model metadata, including information about the training data, model hyperparameters, performance metrics, and deployment details. The start_run() function creates a new MLflow run, which serves as a container for all the metadata associated with the model.

# Within the run, various log_param() and log_metrics() functions are used to record information about the model, and the sklearn.log_model() function is used to save the trained model as an artifact within MLflow.

# Finally, the register_model() function is used to register the model with MLflow and capture its version, which can be used to track changes to the model over time. The deploy_model() function is then called to deploy the model to a production environment, and additional deployment details are logged using the log_param() function.
